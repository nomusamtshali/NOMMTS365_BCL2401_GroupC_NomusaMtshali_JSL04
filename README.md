# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

# Project Overview

- In this project, I was given the task to use ternary operators to make decisions based on the different scenarios/challenges involving Monster Energy drinks. In each scenario/challenge, the ternary operator decides between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- My GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Challenges Faced

- One of the challenges I faced was the complexity of the ternary operators. Although ternary operators are concise, they can be difficult to understand, especially when I had to use it in the first challenge. I managed to get a better understanding on how to use ternary operators through YouTube videos.

## Areas of Improvement

- To use the ternary operators more often to code more complex conditions.

# Overall Learning Experience

- Overall, using ternary operators in the project was a great learning experience, as it exposed the advantages and disadvantages of ternary operators. The advantages include the conciseness and efficiency of ternary operators, while the disadvantages include the complexity and difficulty of debugging them. Overall, it was a great way to learn one of the different programming techniques.
